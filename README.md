#### **Jack 'en Poy**

A simple, easy to play game by Filipino children. It's our term for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

To run the program:

`python main.py`

Here, you will play against the computer. You will choose among three choices:

- "Bato" for Rock 
- "Papel" for Paper
- "Gunting" for Scissors

*Bato* beats *Gunting*, *Papel* beats *Bato*, and *Gunting* beats *Papel* are the only rules of the game.

You can play the game as many times as you want, and the current score between you and the computer is recorded with each run.
To exit the game, just press **E/e** at the console.
